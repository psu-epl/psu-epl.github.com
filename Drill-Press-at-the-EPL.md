# Drill Press

The EPL has a Central Machinery 10" 12-speed drill
press. It's a drill press: there's not so much to say
about it.

# Operating Procedure

For safety, make sure you are wearing eye protection. Keep
your fingers clear and lower the bit slowly: you'd be
surprised how easy it is to drill your finger.

Make sure that the hole in the table is centered so that the
drill bit will not hit it.

## Changing Speed

It is rarely necessary to change the drill press speed.

For safety, please unplug the drill press before changing
the speed. Otherwise, a bumped power switch could cause you
to be injured by a belt.

The belt loosening mechanism (two stop thumbscrews on either
side of the motor casing) is pretty non-functional. You will
have to just horse the top belt off the center pulley if you
want to change the bottom belt position.
