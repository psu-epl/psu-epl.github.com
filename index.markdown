![The L.I.D.](/images/lab_panorama.jpg)

The L.I.D. is a lab for rapidly prototyping electronics projects. It is meant for
students and the community to be able to walk in with an idea and walk out with a
fully functioning prototype.

<!-- **[Watch an introductory video on the lab](http://youtu.be/P7JFAv6JM00 "YouTube")**. -->

The L.I.D. is located on the lower level of the PSU Fourth Avenue Building
(FAB) at 1900 SW 4th Avenue in room **FAB 84-20**. Our phone number is
503-725-2879.

Read about all of our equipment and policies on our **[wiki](https://github.com/psu-epl/psu-epl.github.com/wiki "PSU L.I.D. Wiki")**.


## Lab Status

The lab is currently to all PSU students and staff, and to the greater Portland community members by
invitation only.


## Using the Labs

It's easy! Here's what you do:

 1. Go to our **[wiki](https://github.com/psu-epl/psu-epl.github.com/wiki "wiki")** and read the instructions on the equipment you want to use.
 2. Check the calendar (below) for office hours.
 3. Come to the lab during those office hours and get trained by an L.I.D. manager on the equipment you want to use. Once you're trained on a piece of equipment, you can come in during any office hours and use that equipment.
 4. Once you've been trained on ALL the equipment, and you're willing to volunteer some hours to open the lab, you're eligible to become an L.I.D. student manager. This gives you 24 hour card key acccess, although it does come with a lot of responsibility. :)
